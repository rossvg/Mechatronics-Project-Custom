# Mechatronics-Project-Custom
2nd year university project. Arduino program for robot to locate, carry, and dunk a miniature ball into a hoop

## About
Robot recieves a bluetooth command indicating where the ball is located. By following black lines on playing field, robot can locate the ball and come within correct distance to pick up the ball with a gripper. The gripper lowers, opens, grabs the ball, closes, and picks the ball up. The robot then drives to the hoop location on the playing field, comes to the correct distance, opens the gripper and drops the ball. The robot returns to the middle position awaiting bluetooth signal for next ball location.

## Setup and Usage
This program was written for a custom robot and therefore not able to be reproduced.
